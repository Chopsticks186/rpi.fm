rpi.fm - Internet Radio Player for the Raspberry Pi
===================================================

Command-line internet radio player using http://www.internet-radio.com's
database and omxplayer for actual playback.

Main features include chosing station by genre, automatic resume of playback
after restart, and demonized playback in the background after quitting.

rpi.fm was written in Perl and uses the following modules:
LWP::Simple, HTML::Parse and Term::ANSIColor for that fancy prompt.
Installation (the latter 2 are part of standard Raspbian Wheezy):
apt-get install libwww-perl libhtml-tree-perl perl-modules
