rpi.fm - Internet Radio Player for the Raspberry Pi
===================================================

Command-line internet radio player using the http://www.internet-radio.com
website and omxplayer for actual playback.

Main features include chosing station by genre, automatic resume of playback
after restart, and demonized playback in the background after quitting.

Installation
------------
rpi.fm was written in Perl and uses the following modules:
LWP::Simple, HTML::Parse and Term::ANSIColor for that fancy prompt
(the latter 2 are part of standard Raspbian Wheezy).

apt-get install libwww-perl # as root
cd rpi.fm
make install # as root
